            </p> Football, also known as association football or soccer, is a sport in which two teams of 11 players attempt to advance the ball into the goal of the opposing team by using any part of their bodies other than their hands and arms. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to handle the ball, and only within the area surrounding the goal that is designated as the penalty area. The team with the most goals scored wins.

                 The history of modern football can be traced back to England in 1863, more than a century ago. But since then there is only one football player who is claimed to be the best player in history.  Football player Lionel Messi from Argentina is regarded as the best player of all time and has won the most Ballon d'Or awards with seven. He also won the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 2009 and The Best FIFA Men's Player award in 2019. He has also won numerous golden boots and scored some of the most absurd goals in football history.
